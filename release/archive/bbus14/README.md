BBViewer 1.34
=============
![BBViewer 1.34](bbviewer.jpg)

What's New in 1.3.4:
* Some of the freezing should be fixed (still looking into though)
* Quality changing was a bit flaky - should work now, but takes a few seconds to switch to a manually selected quality when you change cameras
* Known issue: Buffer and Bandwidth info still isn't accurate
